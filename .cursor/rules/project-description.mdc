description: This project aims to automate the migration of websites created with Tilda (a no-code website builder) to WordPress. Tilda allows exporting websites as .zip archives that contain all necessary HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and image assets. Given the repetitive and time-consuming nature of manually converting dozens of Tilda websites into WordPress, this tool will streamline the process through a web-based GUI built using Flask. The tool will allow the user to upload a .zip file containing a Tilda export. It will then parse the content, extract structured data (such as page titles, text blocks, images, and page slugs), and use the WordPress REST API to programmatically recreate the website within a new WordPress installation hosted on Hostinger. All SEO-relevant slugs, metadata, and content structures will be preserved. This approach ensures efficiency, scalability, and consistent quality across multiple website migrations. The end goal is a lightweight Flask-based dashboard where users can: Upload the exported .zip file, Map content to WordPress, Initiate the migration process, View logs and migration status, Maintain SEO integrity by preserving original Tilda URLs.

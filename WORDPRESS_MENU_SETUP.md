# WordPress Menu Creation for Fuseservice Theme (WordPress 6.8+)

This guide explains how automatic menu creation works with your Fuseservice WordPress theme during Tilda-to-WordPress migration using the native WordPress REST API.

## 🎯 Overview

Starting with WordPress 5.9 (and enhanced in 6.8+), WordPress includes native REST API endpoints for menu creation. The migration tool now automatically creates the primary navigation menu for your Fuseservice theme with proper hierarchy, linking to migrated pages.

**✅ No Plugin Required!** The menu creation now uses WordPress's built-in `/wp/v2/menus` and `/wp/v2/menu-items` endpoints.

## 📋 Setup Requirements

### WordPress Version
- **WordPress 6.8+** (recommended) or **WordPress 5.9+** (minimum)
- Your Hostinger WordPress installation should meet this requirement

### User Permissions
- Your WordPress user must have **Administrator role** or `manage_options` capability
- This is required for menu creation via REST API

### Theme Compatibility
- Your Fuseservice theme should register the `primary` menu location
- Based on your header.php, this is already configured correctly:

```php
if ( has_nav_menu( 'primary' ) ) {
    wp_nav_menu(
        array(
            'menu_class'      => '',
            'theme_location'  => 'primary',
            'container'       => 'div',
            'container_class' => 'fs-header__menu',
            'depth'           => 2,
        )
    );
}
```

## 🚀 How It Works

### Automatic Menu Creation Process

1. **Parse menu.json** from Tilda export
2. **Create WordPress menu** using `/wp/v2/menus` endpoint
3. **Add menu items** using `/wp/v2/menu-items` endpoint with proper hierarchy:
   - Root items (e.g., "Services", "About")
   - Child items (e.g., "Services" → "HVAC Services" → "AC Repair")
4. **Link to migrated pages** using WordPress page IDs
5. **Assign to 'primary' location** automatically

### Menu Structure Example

```
Main Navigation (assigned to 'primary')
├── Home (links to migrated home page)
├── Services (links to /services page)
│   ├── HVAC Services (links to /hvac-services page)
│   │   ├── AC Repair (links to /hvac-services/ac-repair)
│   │   └── Heat Pump (links to /hvac-services/heat-pump)
│   └── Appliance Services (links to /appliance-services)
├── Service Areas (links to /service-area page)
│   ├── Monterey (links to /service-area/monterey)
│   └── Salinas (links to /service-area/salinas)
├── About (links to /about page)
└── Contact (links to /contacts page)
```

## 📝 Migration Log Output

During migration, you'll see logs like:

```
✓ Connected successfully as admin
✓ Created page: 'Home' (/) -> https://yoursite.com/
✓ Created page: 'Services' (/services) -> https://yoursite.com/services/
✓ Created page: 'HVAC Services' (/hvac-services) -> https://yoursite.com/hvac-services/
⚠ Skipped page: 'About' (/about) - Page already exists (ID: 123)
✓ Primary menu created successfully using WordPress native REST API
✓ Menu assigned to 'primary' location for fuseservice theme
🎉 Migration completed! 12/12 pages successful (100%)
```

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

### Permission Issues
**Error**: `Menu creation requires 'manage_options' capability`
**Solution**: 
1. Ensure your WordPress user has Administrator role
2. Check that your Application Password has full access
3. Verify the username and password are correct

### Menu Not Appearing
**Check**: Go to WordPress Admin → Appearance → Menus
- "Main Navigation" should exist and be assigned to "Primary Navigation"
- If not assigned, manually assign it to the Primary Navigation location

### Menu Items Not Linking
1. **Page creation**: Ensure pages were created successfully before menu creation
2. **URL structure**: Check that page slugs match the menu href values from Tilda

### WordPress Version Issues
**Error**: `404` when creating menus
**Solution**: 
- Verify WordPress version is 5.9+ by going to Dashboard → Updates
- If older than 5.9, update WordPress to get the menu REST API endpoints

## 🔍 Manual Verification

After migration, verify in WordPress Admin:

1. **Pages**: Admin → Pages - All migrated pages should be listed with proper hierarchy
2. **Menus**: Admin → Appearance → Menus
   - "Main Navigation" should exist with all menu items
   - Should be assigned to "Primary Navigation" location
3. **Frontend**: Visit your site - Navigation should appear in header with working links

## 🛠️ REST API Endpoints Used

The migration tool uses these WordPress native endpoints:

- **Create Menu**: `POST /wp/v2/menus`
- **Add Menu Items**: `POST /wp/v2/menu-items` 
- **Update Menu**: `PUT /wp/v2/menus/{id}`
- **Authentication**: WordPress Application Password

These endpoints are available in WordPress 5.9+ and fully supported in 6.8+.

## 📞 Need Help?

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check WordPress Version**: Must be 5.9+ (6.8+ recommended)
2. **Verify User Permissions**: Administrator role required
3. **Check Migration Logs**: Look for specific error messages
4. **Manual Menu Creation**: Can always be done in Admin → Appearance → Menus

## 🎨 Theme Integration

Your Fuseservice theme will automatically display the menu because it's properly configured to use the `primary` menu location. The CSS classes in your theme (`fs-header__menu`) will style the menu correctly.

## ✨ Benefits of Native API

- **No Plugin Required**: Uses WordPress core functionality
- **Better Compatibility**: Works with all themes and WordPress versions 5.9+
- **More Reliable**: Uses official WordPress endpoints
- **Future-Proof**: Will continue working with future WordPress updates
- **Faster Setup**: No plugin installation or configuration needed
